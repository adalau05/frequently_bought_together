# FBT analysis (Pair Counting method)

“Frequently Bought Together” (FBT) analysis finds which products tend to be purchased in the same basket. It’s one of the core techniques behind product recommendations on Amazon, grocery stores, retail POS systems, and e-commerce sites.

The pair-count algorithm finds frequently-bought-together items by looking at every shopping basket, listing all item pairs inside it, and counting how often each pair appears.
